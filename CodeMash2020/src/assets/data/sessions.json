      "description": "Constructing and administering a big data scale Extract, Transform & Load (ETL) and Business Intelligence (BI) pipeline can be expensive and complicated. Fortunately, Amazon Web Services (AWS) simplifies this with Glue and QuickSight services. Glue, a fully managed, serverless and cloud-optimized ETL service, ingests data from files or databases. QuickSight, a BI tool, provides data analysis and insights on the ingested data.\r\n\r\nIn this hands-on workshop, you will start by using Amazon’s S3, Athena and Redshift services to store and access data. You will utilize Glue, Python and PySpark to transform data into the desired formats and data sources. Finally, you will learn how to enable business users to make better decisions with QuickSight’s drillable dashboards. ",

      "description": "What can play games on the go, show your best face to the world, establish your geek creds way better than any iPhone, and potentially do some useful work too?  Why, the \"official\" CodeMash 2020 IoT Badge of course!\r\n \r\nIn this workshop, you will construct your very own battery-powered WiFi-enabled badge based on the capable ESP32 microcontroller.  You’ll see a demo of the system and how it works, the key electronic components, and the basic techniques you'll need for assembly.  Then it’s time to dive right in and bring your badge to life.  After that, you'll load up the provided testbench to make sure the hardware checks out and finally test drive some games and apps that you can use either as-is or as launchpads for your own awesome ideas.\r\n\r\nNot only will you walk away with a cool piece of techno-bling to show the world, you’ll also have a better understanding of how to build hardware projects of your own. \r\n \r\nNo prior electronics, soldering, or C/C++ programming experience is required.  You must bring your fully-charged laptop and a micro USB cable to connect your laptop to the ESP32.  Bringing your smartphone with a QR code scanning app on it is strongly suggested.  All other hardware and tools will be provided at the session.  Pre-requisite software and library installation instructions will be sent out before the conference.  The goblins running the internet kindly request that you load these to your laptop prior to the workshop.\r\n\r\n ***Special note: an additional ticket purchase is necessary to keep the IoT Badge hardware that you will build in this session. Tickets will be available on Eventbrite a few weeks prior to CodeMash. \r\n",

      "title": "Bringing ML to Mobile Apps - Let's build an app to perform Face Recognition using Flutter",
      "description": "The Background\r\nFlutter is Google’s cross-platform development framework for quickly crafting high-quality native apps on Web, iOS, Android, and ChromeOS in record time. \r\n\r\nFlutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source. Notable apps written in Flutter include Abbey Road Studios first mobile app, Topline, the Hamilton Broadway Musical app, and Alibaba's Xianyu mobile app.\r\n\r\nFirebase is Google's set of back-end services for mobile developers to quickly build out mobile apps for both Android and iOS. It is a set of 17 services that currently support 1.5 million mobile apps. The services range from Push Notifications, and Remote Configuration, all the way to supporting best in class Machine Learning models for use in mobile apps.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate how powerful the combination of Flutter and Firebase is, we will be building a cross-platform mobile app to perform face-recognition in real-time from the device's camera. \r\n\r\nIn this workshop we will develop this app using one codebase written in Flutter hooking into Firebase's APIs. Face recognition will be performed using a pre-built machine learning model built by Google and provided within Firebase. This machine learning model will run on the mobile device providing real-time detection with no network latency. The mobile app we will build can easily be extended to support many other types of Machine Learning models including custom models.     \r\n\r\nHow will we do this?\r\nIn this hands-on workshop, we will start from scratch with no expectation of prior knowledge of Flutter. \r\n\r\nBelow is the schedule for the work-shop,  \r\n30 minutes - Intro to Flutter\r\n30 minutes - Set up the Flutter development environment on attendees computers\r\n30 minutes - Start coding the UI for the project step by step\r\n15 minutes - Break\r\n30 minutes - Finish off the UI for the project\r\n30 minutes - Intro to Firebase\r\n30 minutes - Setup Firebase for the project\r\n30 minutes - Add the code to support Face Recognition from Firebase MLKit to the project\r\n30 minutes - Celebrate! Wrap-up and questions\r\n\r\nThis entire workshop and all steps will be available beforehand as a GitHub repo. A example of how I plan on structuring the source code and the presentation can be found here -> https://github.com/donwardpeng/Flutter-DetTechWatch)\r\n\r\nWhat will attendees walk away with?\r\nThe goal is for everyone to walk away with the understanding of how to build a mobile app that runs machine learning in real time (specifically face recognition). Additionally, at the end of the session, everyone should be have a working codebase for this app. ",

As a developer, it’s easy for you to jump right into the code when given a problem to solve, but what if you build something that nobody wants? Taking the time to design and research your product can help you better meet the needs of customers while avoiding potential rework down the line. This hands-on workshop will present you with a problem that needs solving and guide you on researching, designing and prototyping a solution. You will work in a small group to evaluate the problem and design a solution. Your group will turn the design into an interactive prototype and conduct usability studies to ensure you’re meeting customer needs. Finally, your group will iterate on the design and present your findings to a stakeholder. At the end of this workshop, you will have the fundamentals needed to research and design the solutions your customers want. You will also learn tactics for selling the value of design and research to your client, and how to best present your research results.",

      "description": "Do you want to learn F# and Functional Programming? Well, you better start coding! Learning a new programming language is not easy, on top of reading a lot you need to practice even more. This workshop is designed to teach you some of the basics of F# and Functional Programming by combining theory (slides) and practice.\r\nAs software becomes more complex, it is imperative to structure it well, to ensure that it is easy to write, debug, and provides a collection of modules that can be reused to reduce future programming costs. Functional Programming has been around for a while, but it is gaining popularity, especially due to direct support in languages on the JVM and the CLR. Writing code in functional style is not about syntax, it is a paradigm shift. In this presentation, using examples in F# and C#, you will learn how to write code in functional style. We will start out discussing the elements of functional programming and then look at examples of some common operations and how you can implement those in functional style.",

      "description": "Being a good developer isn’t just about slinging code; we’re part of a community. Interacting with others in a community means feelings are involved.\r\n\r\nBut feelings are messy and uncomfortable, so why can’t you just ignore them? Because emotional skills are critical for working well on a team. \r\n\r\nYou may have heard that emotional intelligence is correlated with career success, but wondered just how to build those skills. In this workshop you will get to practice working with:\r\n\r\n* Your API - using the metaphor of an API to understand the foundations of how emotions work\r\n* Observability of ourselves - check in on yourself and better understand what happens below the surface\r\n* Observability of a group - share your state with others\r\n* Inter-Process Communication: emotions and experiences shape your motivations and create blockers for you\r\n* Troubleshooting - When interpersonal communication goes wrong, how to restore relationships and communication to work together again",

      "description": "Threat modeling is a way of thinking about what could go wrong and how to prevent it. Instinctively, we all think this way in regards to our own personal security and safety. When it comes to building software, some software shops either skip the important step of threat modeling in secure software design or, they have tried threat modeling before but haven't quite figured out how to connect the threat models to real world software development and its priorities. Threat modeling should be part of your secure software design process. Using threat modeling and some principals of risk management, you can design software in a way that makes security one of the top goals, along with performance, scalability, reliability, and maintenance.\r\n\r\nObjective: In this workshop, attendees will be introduced to Threat Modeling, learn how to conduct a Threat Modeling session, learn how to use practical strategies in finding Threats, learn how find realistic Countermeasures, and learn how to apply Risk Management in dealing with the threats. \r\n\r\nThis is a hands-on workshop. We will use whiteboards, Threat Modeling card games, look at some of the available Threat Modeling tools - all in order to get familiar with the latest approaches in Threat Modeling. ",

If so, this is the session for you! In this TDD workshop, we will be building the domain model for EverCraft -- a new MMORPG from Blizzards of the Coast.  We have lots of story cards prepared to cover features from combat to magic, classes to spells, and races to items. Plus, we'll be defining some of these cards during the session in case you want that +9 knife of ogre slaying or enjoy casting magic missile at the darkness.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is language agnostic and for all levels of developers. The focus is on TDD and emergent design but pair programming will be covered as well. The only requirement is that you bring a laptop and that you be able to test-drive your code with your language of choice.  When you are done you will emerge a better programmer for the experience but there is a small chance you will have a craving for Cheetos and Mountain Dew.",

Why, the \"official\" CodeMash 2020 IoT Badge of course!\r\n \r\nThis session will use the badge created in Part 1 and take a closer look at hardware troubleshooting techniques, considerations for adding sensors or other components,  and the tools and strategies you can use for creating your own microcontroller-based projects.  We’ll start with the apps introduced in the morning session, and then personalize them to be uniquely yours.  Want to be a 1920's gangster?  A magical prison escapee?  A data-driven mad scientist?  This session will provide the tools to take your badge to the next level!  \r\n \r\nBadge My IoT Life, Part 1 is a pre-requisite.  Bring your laptop, smartphone, and some basic photo editing software.  Prior coding experience with a C-based language is helpful, but not required.\r\n\r\n ***Special note: an additional ticket purchase is necessary to keep the IoT Badge hardware that you will build in this session. Tickets will be available on Eventbrite a few weeks prior to CodeMash. \r\n",

You will start a sandbox cluster, interact with HDFS, learn how HDFS saves data and why it does it that way.  MapReduce is an important processing paradigm, learn why and explore some of the Computer Science theory behind the technology.  Write a simple MapReduce job, old school but effective.  YARN is brains behind massive data processing jobs.  Learn how it makes decisions and watch it run your MapReduce job. ",

      "description": "This hands-on session is aimed at mobile app developers, QA testers, aspiring security testers, and other suspicious persons.\r\n\r\nModern mobile app development abstracts away most low-level interaction with the operating system. It is common to rely on third-party modules to handle sensitive data or perform critical tasks. What really happens when an application’s state is updated? Or biometric authentication requested? What are the analytics packages talking about behind your back? Mobile platforms (and iOS in particular) tend to make introspection difficult, .\r\n\r\nYou will learn how to look under the hood of a running application, using open source tools and unmodified devices. Topics include:\r\n - Packaging and instrumenting an application with Frida\r\n - Monitoring and manipulating HTTP traffic\r\n - Browsing the application’s files, databases, and Keychain entries\r\n - Lying to the application with hooked functions\r\n - Easy mode w/ virtualization\r\n - Occasional Android comparisons\r\n - Thoughts on automation\r\n\r\nStudents must bring a laptop, with MacBooks being strongly recommended. Windows instructions will be provided, with some limitations. Please arrive with the following tools installed: XCode w/ command line tools, iTunes, NodeJS 10.x, Python 3.x (plus virtualenv), an OpenVPN client, and an intercepting proxy of your choice (OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Charles Proxy, etc). Students will be provided access to virtualized iOS devices.\r\n\r\nAfter completing this workshop, students will be able to inspect their iOS applications for common security flaws. This includes the ability to inspect and manipulate an application’s network traffic, files, and function calls.\r\n",

It has use cases from asynchronous calls to UI development, but unfortunately most tutorials and\r\nexplanations are filled with theory and marble diagrams. Trying to get started with the tech can be both tantalizing because it sounds great, and difficult because the use cases aren't clear.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop we'll take a hands-on approach to learning Rx, using TypeScript for widespread applicability. We'll start with simple use cases and build up to complex and dynamic UIs. As we do we'll see how Rx can make your application both easier to write and easier to read.\r\n",

      "description": "It’s been a battle, but the code is finally working. It’s time to clean it up, but not so fast, something else is on fire and the code has to be pushed as it is.  Whenever there is time to refactor something else comes up. Of course, this doesn’t just happen once. A quick change here. A little hack there. Now it’s spaghetti code and everyone is terrified of opening the file and even more afraid that someone else will see it.\r\n\r\nRefactoring can feel like an insurmountable task, but it doesn’t have to be. Participants in this workshop will learn a mental framework for refactoring that will give them the tools to attack their technical debt head on.\r\n\r\nParticipants will start with a project that mirrors many typical code problems. Next, they will learn to develop tests that will give them the confidence they need to change their code without breaking functionality, or introducing new bugs. Then they’ll learn how to break down code down into smaller, refactorable pieces. Finally, they’ll get to work on the sample project so you can test out these techniques for themselves. When they head back to work, they’ll be ready to handle anything that legacy code can throw at them.\r\n",

If you’ve ever looked inside a computer, you probably saw a bunch of circuit boards with a bunch of electronics stuff attached to them. Each of those pieces was soldered to the board: it’s a process of joining electronic parts together by heating up metal and melting it around the parts.\r\n\r\nLearning how to solder is the first step to learning how to build any electronics. And it’s not hard to do! In this workshop, we’ll go over the basics of soldering, learn how to do it safely, and do our first soldering together! Each participant will make a badge with an LED that will light up and let everyone know that they know how to solder!\r\n\r\n12 maximum participants. \r\nDivez are designed for ages 12+.",

Before we start, there will be some setup for labs and tools – so plan some time in advance and bring your Windows, Macintosh, or Linux laptop!\r\n\r\nWe will cover problems and solutions as they relate to application security and principles of application security\r\nDemo a purposefully vulnerable web application, and work with tools.  Then we will cover some specifics, at a pace for everyone!\r\n\r\nAuthentication: Covers all aspects of secure authentication, including building secure login screens, password storage, secure interactions between sites, and an overview of many other topics.\r\n\r\nInjection: SQL, command, LDAP injection, just to name a few. Sending your commands to a backend system\r\n\r\nBrowser attacks: Finding and exploiting cross site scripting vulnerabilities\r\n\r\nIt will be easier if you bring a basic understanding of HTTP protocols and web applications.

No high-level tech demos, but a real-life application that is used in schools. Building an educational game, with robots fighting to the death, from scratch, will be a blast. This will include backend web services, a frontend Unity client to visualize the battle and middleware processing services using the Microsoft Compiler Platform (Roslyn). The point of this workshop is to show how technology is evolved to make development easy and create useful applications in only a few hours of hardcore coding. At the end of the workshop, the finished game can be actually played!",

      "title": "Building Quality JavaScript With Test-Driven Development",
      "description": "Learning Test-Driven Development (TDD) is frustrating. The first couple tests feel strange - you wonder why you're writing tests that fail on purpose. Before long, you find yourself behind schedule from spending so much time on tests. You abandon unit testing completely. You'll write them after....if you find the time.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will ease the frustration of learning Test-Driven Development. We'll discuss the fundamentals of TDD and work together to solve problems in a test-driven manner. You'll build confidence in your ability to apply TDD in JavaScript with hands-on experience. \r\n\r\nTopics and activities include:\r\n\r\n* Instruction and exercises that will familiarize you with Jest as a JavaScript test framework\r\n* An introduction to the fundamentals of TDD\r\n* An instructor-led demonstration of TDD in practice\r\n* A collaborative code kata to get a hands-on, practical introduction to TDD\r\n* A series of hands-on exercises writing test-driven JavaScript code\r\n* A discussion of best practices for keeping your JavaScript test-friendly\r\n\r\nWe'll be using Jest to build quality into our JavaScript code from the start. No specific UI framework will be targeted in this workshop - we will focus on writing and testing pure JavaScript. The experience you gain will be applicable to any JavaScript-based app, regardless of your framework allegiance.\r\n\r\nParticipants should be able to read and write JavaScript, as no time will be spent on language details. General familiarity with writing unit tests in any language is required. Familiarity with Test-Driven Development is helpful but not required, and no TDD experience is necessary. No experience with Jest is necessary.\r\n\r\nA laptop with the LTS version of NodeJS installed (currently 10.16.3) is required. The corresponding version of NPM (currently 6.9.0) is also required. Detailed setup instructions are at https://stevenhicks.me/tdd-setup.",

      "description": "Companies nowadays are finding it critical to be able to gather and analyze massive amounts of disparately-sourced data, quickly and reliably. By diving into the fundamentals of Apache Kafka, you will learn how it can be more than a superior, distributed messaging system, but also a platform to handle all your stream processing needs. In this session, we'll start by reviewing the basics; topics, producers, consumers, and beyond. Then discover how to operationalize data pipelines, easily maintaining and monitoring them throughout a full production lifecycle. After completing this session, you’ll have learned how to use Kafka for many of your data needs, merging the worlds of data consumption, processing, and devops.",

Not just for gaming (though that's cool too), a new dimension of experience simulation is now open to designers of software as well as physical products, to observe customer interaction and gather feedback without ever having to create a real product. In this session, explore the hardware and software tools, and the varying techniques we can leverage to put potential customers into a world unlike anything they're used to, or even places they're already familiar with. Learn how to observe their interactions with those experiences, empathize with them in specific contexts and better understand their behaviors. Discover how we can help solve problems or create new engaging content that fits their needs with this new virtual realm. Finally, learn how to validate physical product ideas, not just software and games. Walk away with everything you need to get started prototyping VR experiences (except the hardware itself). ",

If you’re looking for a way to increase visibility into your application beyond plain text logs, this is the pre-compiler for you!\r\n\r\nIn this half-day, hands-on workshop you will receive an in depth introduction to a suite of open source tools that you can use to monitor the performance of your applications and the infrastructure they run on.  While the application and instrumentation library used in this session will be JVM oriented, many of the tools and concepts will be transferable to other languages.\r\n\r\nMicrometer is a Java metrics library from Pivotal (and the default metrics library for Spring Boot) that allows you to instrument your application once and export metrics to many popular monitoring systems.\r\n\r\nPrometheus is a monitoring and alerting tool that allows you to easily store and query your application metrics with minimal operational overhead.\r\n\r\nGrafana is a visualization tool that allows you to easily generate and manage beautiful graphs and dashboards from data stored in Prometheus (as well as many other backends).\r\n",

      "description": "Knitting is a relaxing and creative endeavor you can practice anywhere that you can carry two sticks and a pocket full of yarn. Bonus: it's binary! (knit…purl…get it?) And there are lots of opportunities to knit for charity, from hats for preemies, to prosthetics for breast cancer survivors. Knitters even have their own social network called Ravelry, where they show off their latest projects and patterns.\r\n\r\nIn this two hour class, you'll learn the whole nine yards of knitting, from casting on, to binding off, and everything in between. If there's enough time and interest, you'll also learn how to spin roving into yarn, using a drop spindle made from nothing more than a stick, a hook, some rubber bands, and a couple of old AOL CDs that fell behind your parents' desk years ago.\r\n\r\n16 maximum participants.\r\nDivez are designed for ages 12+.",

      "description": "Note: This precompiler will require an additional ticket purchase in order to retain the Arduino hardware featured in the presentation.\r\n\r\nModern vehicles are critically vulnerable. They rely on many electronic computers and sensors which communicate by broadcasting critical information over many Controller Area Networks (CANs). CANs are required by legislation on modern vehicles for emission and diagnostic purposes. Previous research has shown that a vehicle’s network has dangerous implications—hackers can collect data from remote vehicles and even disrupt vehicle control. Although automotive manufacturers are evolving to protect against these intrusions, the practical application of cybersecurity in the field remains inconsistent. In this precompiler, attendees will build their own automotive interface centered around the Arduino ecosystem. We will use these do-it-yourself CAN tools to sniff traffic from a simulated automobile and identify functional signals from the network. Further, we will inject arbitrary data to affect vehicle function and understand basic diagnostic applications. By the end of the presentation, we will build an intrusion detection system which will help protect vehicles at home and in motion.\r\n\r\nWaiver: Not responsible for DMCA violations, bricked cars, or accidents.

      "title": "Ensure Your Users Experience - A Trip Around User Validation Tools",
      "description": "In today’s fast feedback world, getting our product in front of users often is incredibly important.  But how do we know our product is ready to go in front of our users.  Sure, we have 1,000’s of unit and integration tests on each of our microservices, but what happens when we put them all together.  Ensuring our expectations of how our product works when all of the pieces are together is the final piece of the puzzle to give us full confidence we are ready to release and ensure our users are having a consistent experience.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we will discuss the different methods we can use to give us the confidence in our product.  The main focus is on the different tools available to automate our validations.  We will spend time getting to know three open source tools, Selenium (and some of the solutions built to use with WebDriver like Protractor and Cucumber) , Cypress.io and TestCafe.  We’ll discuss best practices for each of the tools as well some ways that we can make our product more testable.  We will also look at how these tools can help share knowledge of our how our product works as well as our products codebase.  And while using these tools is a great way to know if we are ready to ship it off, we’ll look at some things you can do in production to ensure that you know of issues your customers are having prior to them even calling you.\r\n\r\nThe hope is after this workshop, you have the knowledge of all of the tools we discuss and the confidence to pick a path forward for you to build your organization’s confidence in your ability to release to production.  Using one, some or all of these tools will open up a new world for areas of your product to worry about and give you more confidence that your users are having the experience they desire and you imagine them having.",

Java 9 was a HUGE release with many impactful features like the module system, jLink, jShell and a hand full of new Project Coin language features. While Java 10 & 11 were small in comparison based on feature count their influence will be felt. The var keyword, Graal and container awareness features along with lambda, thread and garbage collection enhancements will improve development and operations.\r\n\r\nThis hands-on workshop will provide the knowledge and experience you need to be prepared to migrate your applications from Java 8 to Java 11 successfully.",

      "description": "Over the past several years we have embraced microservices as a way to “break up the monolith” and reduce complexity, allowing teams to focus on specific areas of functionality, while providing more flexible scaling and better fault isolation. However, for most of us, the front-end has remained largely un-touched — it is, in essence, still a monolith. What if the same team was responsible for the UI and the service, an you could compose a web app out of different micro frontends — each providing a core set a functionality but all playing well with each other? This tutorial explains how that process can work, using Web Components as the bridge between different JavaScript frameworks on the front end, and Eclipse MicroProfile for the Java microservice on the back-end.",

      "description": "Have you attempted a microservices architecture and struggled? Have you read about event sourcing and CQRS, but are disappointed to only find high-level descriptions? Want to get hands-on and actually learn these concepts in the context of a functioning system? This workshop does just that.\r\n\r\nThis workshop covers:\r\n\r\n* The difference between applications and services and how to avoid the dreaded distributed monolith (spoiler: it isn't about docker or Go---it's a data model)\r\n* Modeling system state as events and organizing those events around the streams that store them\r\n* Reshaping those events into view data and showing it to users\r\n\r\nCome learn the basics of microservices, an architectural pattern that keeps your team productive.",

If only you could capture these insights and save them forever...\r\n\r\nSwift can help -- but we're NOT going to build an iOS app! Server Side Swift has gone from a fun idea to a robust, mature platform for moving data from the backend to the front. In the first half of this precompiler, we're going to build a fully functional backend in Swift, using Vapor. Then we'll leverage that backend to support a web app templated in Leaf and hosted on Heroku for you to compile notes on the CodeMash sessions you'll attend during the week. And since we know conference wifi can move at the pace of the Kalahari's lazy river, we'll use the second half of the precompiler to build a Mac app that shares authentication and network infrastructure with our web app. We'll use Server Side Swift to save CodeMash forever!",

Today, XAML powers a lot of app platforms and seems poised for success going forward. And almost all of XAML application stacks are now open source!\r\n\r\nWant pure Windows desktop apps – WPF XAML got you covered. Want apps for every Windows device – tablets, Surface Hubs or Hololens? UWP XAML provides a rich ecosystem. Want to stretch UWP XAML over to iOS/Android or WebAssembly? Uno Platform has you covered. And Xamarin.Forms XAML allows developers to target various mobile platforms from single code base. But Xamarin.Forms’ reach goes beyond just mobile platforms of iOS, Android & Windows – did you know your Xamarin.Forms XAML could target MacOS, Tizen, Smart Watches, Smart TVs, Refrigerators & Hololens? And it’s not just futuristic devices or platforms, you could take Xamarin.Forms goodness back to WPF & even Web! Yes, we’re talking XAML being back in the browser – just done right this time. \r\n\r\nLet’s unpack the magic behind democratization of X-platform .NET development.

      "description": "Python is a wonderful language for writing simple scripts. But have you ever wondered how to go to the next level? What does it take to create a library, a desktop application, or a web application in Python? How does documentation, testing, packaging, and deployment work? What are all these crazy in-jokes about a British Comedy Troupe? And why is there so much angst about upgrading from a major version to the next? This talk will cover all of that and more to get you started on the right foot for developing more than just a script or two in Python.",

      "description": "We all strive to write clean, concise, reusable code. Everyone's had a moment of looking at a 500-line file or a 50-line method and thinking, \"This is just too much code!\" There can be real joy in breaking a giant mess into small, tidy bits. But when does the quest for brevity lead us into a swamp of complication? Is there such thing as too LITTLE code? Can a method that does too little be just as dangerous as one that does too much? When we treat deleting lines of code as a good thing in and of itself, we run the risk of creating code that's harder to understand. Let's find the balance between extreme loquacity and excessive concision and then navigate the sensible middle path between less and more.\r\n",

You’ll master how to communicate effectively with key stakeholders by taking a data-driven approach blended with storytelling techniques to bridge common gaps between development and business stakeholders. You’ll explore the 7 tools of software quality and how they can bring clarity and sanity to the decision-making process, justify paying down technical debt, and focusing on improving our software in the areas that need it most.",

      "description": "Architecture has existed for the better part of human history. Over 2000 years ago, the Roman architect Vitruvius claimed that a good building must be durable, functional, and bring delight. Sounds familiar, right? This session will explore how architectural design concepts such as 'less is more', 'form vs. function', and 'adaptive reuse' can be applied to the software patterns and structure in your own applications. You'll discover how the successes (and plenty of failures!) in building design over the years provide timeless lessons for designing and architecting software that will stand the test of time.",

Sometimes, EF is just right for the job, but other times you want something more simple, with better control of the generated SQL queries, and more performant. Over the years, several micro-ORMs (object relationship mappers) have evolved for just this purpose, because often, the simplest solution is the best one.\r\n\r\nCome along on this walk-through of some popular alternatives to EF, an overview of .NET micro-ORMs, and useful design patterns that you can use to organize them all into a powerful, fast, and coherent data access later. Leave this sessions armed to make a simple, high-performance, and easy to use data access layer that you can be proud of.",

But RxJS is efficient and expressive! We declare relationships between entities, describing the what not the how. The basic sequence operators, map, filter, and reduce, are probably familiar from using them in array chains. RxJS is a core part of the Angular framework used in everything from Reactive Forms to the HTTP module. Harnessing observables with Angular’s async pipe is essential to building clean and concise components. Developers can overcome the RxJS learning curve by focussing on core concepts like hot vs cold observables, piping operations, and a few of the most common operators.",

      "description": "The goal of this workshop is to document yourself the way you would document code. You wouldn’t expect someone who wants to use the program you built to read every line of code. Instead, they’re relying on the design documents and doc strings to know how it works. The same is true with your career. This workshop is about making it easy for you to provide overwhelming evidence of your value to the company. When you can show your ROI, it’s much easier to secure that promotion, raise or new job that you deserve. \r\n\r\nThis workshop consists of 3 parts. Writing your daily accomplishments in the form of success statements. Putting them together into a brag sheet. And finally using them to create your elevator pitch. Using this framework makes it easy to make a habit of documenting, the same way a style guide helps you document your code. Once you have documented yourself, you will be amazed at how much you have accomplished. You will walk out of the workshop with the confidence and plan to take your next step.",

      "description": "As the world becomes more and more connected, the way people communicate becomes more and more important. A prominent example is emoji: those little icons that are popular in text messages 📱 and on social media 🤝. Proposals for new emoji will often make the news. But did you know that emoji are just a small part of the larger Unicode Standard, aimed at unifying all forms of written language into one system? By supporting Unicode in your apps, your users can use the latest emoji 🆕 and also communicate in over 80 written languages. This talk will demystify Unicode. It will include an overview of the key concepts and problems in text encoding, the history of Unicode and emoji, a comparison of the different ways you can encode Unicode characters (e.g., UTF-8), and examples of using Unicode in a variety of programming languages and platforms. Afterward, you’ll be ready to take your apps all around the globe 🌎🌍🌏 with a smile 😄.",

      "description": "Software development is an activity that’s fraught with complexity, ambiguity, and therefore risk. Many organizations attempt to mitigate that risk through stringent processes, but there is a better way.\r\n\r\nIn nature, there are three types of systems.\r\n\r\n1. Fragile systems that break under stress, like a teacup.\r\n2. Resilient systems that resist stress, like a rock.\r\n3. Antifragile systems that become stronger when they are stressed, like your muscles when you exercise.\r\n\r\nMost organizations attempt to build resilience, but do so in a way that nearly guarantees fragility. Designing for \"antifragility\" is a much better goal.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you will learn about the concepts of antifragility, the concepts of teams (as opposed to working groups) and how we can apply antifragile concepts to make our teams less fragile:\r\n\r\n* Why mass standardization and strict process control does not result in robustness.\r\n* Long-lived teams may be a major cause of fragility.\r\n* The proper role of an agile coach.\r\n* Different teams in the same organization should look, act, and operate differently.\r\n* The best way to stay stable and predictable is to embrace volatility and chaos.\r\n* The unintended side-effects of intervening to fix the mistakes of a team.\r\n* How to strengthen your team.",

You've enjoyed that they give you consistent components and layout. \r\n\r\nBut perhaps you've been frustrated by those same tools. It could be that every site you have created with them looks the same. Or maybe you've gotten into fights with your design team as they ask for a look and feel that is nearly impossible for you to pull off.\r\n\r\nThat was me until recently. Combining React, design systems and Storybook, my team and I were able to create our own component library from scratch, and it was easier than I could have imagined.\r\n\r\nBut more than just having our own framework, we found that our team was much more collaborative involving developers and designers as we created a custom UI for our client.\r\n\r\nThis talk walks through our experience, lessons learned, and highlights some tools and libraries that were essential in creating our own UI framework.

      "description": "Developing apps is time consuming, with little guarantee of success. The Web, App Store, Google Play and beyond are littered with apps making low or no revenue because they don't solve problems people actually care about. Before you build your “killer” ap, how can you truly know beyond the shadow of a doubt that there’s actual demand for it?  In this session, learn how to discern whether people will actually buy, use and love your product before you put in all that effort! This amusing, fast-paced workshop teaches several product prototyping and experimentation techniques that you can use right away to prove whether your product or feature ideas have worth, or to help you transform non-valuable ideas to valuable ones. \r\n\r\nWhether you work solo or on a team, no matter what kind of product you work on, this workshop will engage you in activities you can take with you back to work and immediately employ to significantly increase the odds of a bigger pay day by building only the parts people would actually use and find value in.

      "description": "Structured logging is a way to bring order and value to your logging. Gone are the days where print debugging was the only option. Now as logs become more complex, developers struggle to pack more information into a single line. The modern solution has emerged: Structured Logging. But this is not just another buzz word to be checked off a list. There is real value in using structured logging in your next project, or even in starting it use it in an existing codebase. Let me show you what structured logging can do for you.",

      "description": "When you’re pitching a mobile app to a prospective client, it’s easy to focus on the app’s raison d’être. A pizza-ordering app should order pizza, a messaging app should send messages, and a game should be fun. For an app to succeed, there are countless other hidden tasks to consider: does your app respond well to poor network connectivity? Is it always clear when it’s waiting on network communication? What happens when you ship the app but need to prevent users from using a broken version? In this talk we’ll look at common examples of the unspoken assumptions made when creating apps—assumptions that clients may have, assumptions users definitely have, and the things no app should leave an App Store without. Using these critical features as a guide, you’ll be better prepared to estimate project length and deliver amazing (and successful) apps.",

While there have been various attempts to dethrone it, they have typically involved treating JavaScript as an assembly-language analog that you transpile your code to. This has lead to complex build pipelines that result in JavaScript which the browser has to parse and *you* still have to debug. But what if there were an actual byte-code language you could compile your non-JavaScript code to instead? That is what WebAssembly is.\r\n\r\nI'm going to explain how WebAssembly works and how to use it in this talk. I'll cover what it is, how it fits into your application, and how to build and use your own WebAssembly modules. And, I'll demo how to build and use those modules with both Rust and the WebAssembly Text Format. That's right, I'll be live coding in an assembly language. I'll also go over some online resources for other languages and tools that make use of WebAssembly.\r\n\r\nWhen we're done, you'll have the footing you need to start building applications featuring WebAssembly. So grab a non-JavaScript language, a modern browser, and let's and get started!",

But how do you know you're doing it right? Are you getting the most out of the strategies you've chosen? In this session you'll learn how best to manage your automation, how different job types and plugins can improve your architecture and decrease your maintenance effort. Almost no matter where you are in your automation maturity, there’s always another level to reach: if you’re using the basic point-and-click of freestyle jobs, you can move to the scripted context of pipelines. Once you’ve explored pipelines, you can learn to leverage shared global libraries to promote code reuse across multiple pipelines. In this session, you’ll learn basics about Jenkins, specific use cases for different job types, and how best to manage your automation as it grows from one job, to ten, to one hundred. Finally, you’ll learn how to create your entire Jenkins job collection from scratch, at the push of a button.",

      "description": "Data as it appears in the real world is naturally connected, but traditional data modeling focuses on entities which can cause for complicated joins of these naturally connected data.  That is where graph databases come in as they store data more like what happens naturally in the real world.  Sure, there a lot of talk about using graph databases for social networks, recommendation engines, and Internet of Things; but using graph databases can also make a lot of sense when working with common business data problems.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will get a better understanding of what graph databases are, how to use the Gremlin API within Azure Cosmos DB to traverse such data structures, and see practical examples to common data problems.",

Then out of nowhere an idea comes to mind, maybe its spurred by a problem that you encountered or a way that you could improve on a technique, you pull from your experiences and decide to start a new project that helps to scratch that itch.  Of course, since we're all tech professionals, we find ourselves building these solutions with the technologies we know, or wish to learn more about.  This is all fantastic, but how do we get started?  What do you do when you're not sure your users will like it?  How do you do this on your own?  And even more importantly, how do you avoid burn out, I mean this is a project to help with a hobby that gets you away from your keyboard and now you're right back at the keyboard instead of doing that hobby you love so much. This talk is also intended to help folks who have had these ideas but get stuck, if those old ideas still inspire you then lets pick them back up off the shelf and  finally finish them, and get them out there for the world to enjoy!",

      "description": "Developing a delivery pipeline means more than just adding automated deploys to the development cycle. It’s about gaining confidence that your builds are viable candidates for release or production. For development to be successful, tests of all types must be incorporated throughout the process to be sure that problems aren’t slipping through. Most pipelines include unit tests, functional tests, and acceptance tests, but those aren’t always enough. I’ll present some types of testing you might not have considered, or at least might not have considered the importance of. Some tests will address code quality, others code security, and some address the health and security of the pipeline itself.\r\n\r\nThis talk is aimed at people that are trying to build confidence in their software delivery pipeline, whether it is automated or not. Gene will talk about specific tools he uses to supplement his pipeline testing. He won’t get into how to use each tool-- this is more of a series of teasers to encourage people to look into the tools, and even letting them know what types of tools and testing opportunities are out there.\r\n",

Nowadays, microservices connect to various APIs. These APIs could differ in protocols (REST/SOAP), where they’re hosted (on-prem/cloud), security (tokens/JWTs) and so on.\r\nLearn how to leverage API Gateways so your microservices are able to fully connect and harness the power of these APIs. This talk will go into details on various API Gateway offerings and a decision matrix on which one to pick. The talk will also highlight the various features of API Gateways like productizing APIs, creating users and subscriptions, security, error handling, rate limiting. We will use Azure API Management to display the awesome power of API Gateways but the principles will be universal.",

Our Systems Administrators aren't monitoring our application servers, it's the SREs determining SLIs and SLOs for our Micro-Services and making sure our Cloud-Distributed systems are Observable in near-real time. It's enough for buzzword burnout. Furthermore, the DevOps movement asking developers to work closer with our operations teams and handle on-call shifts! Does that mean you have to learn everything about DevOps and SRE just to keep doing what you truly love, building things out of code? \r\n\r\nNot entirely, but just as SysOps folk have started to learn valuable lessons about codifying their work, so too can developers learn how to own software in production from those that have been doing it every day.\r\n\r\nWithout diving through the whole world of Software Reliability Engineering and systems monitoring, this talk will level set and give a crash course on Observability. Let’s cross-class some Ops with our Dev and build reliable, maintainable software together! \r\n\r\nAttendees will walk away with an understanding of:\r\n\r\n- A level-set understanding of Observability so they can collaborate with their colleagues meaningfully.\r\n- How cross-collaboration and a shared language provide for better quality software development\r\n- A handful of ideas to keep in mind during development, to make operating software easier\r\n- Why Developers should be On-Call, too, and the value that provides for both the Ops teams AND for building better software.",

Agile was meant to free us from the confines of red-tape driven software, but most of us can't help but feel something is off in our software process.\r\n\r\nDo you wonder why startups can launch an entire product in a few months, but it took your team 6 months to get that new feature into production?\r\n\r\nDo you get tired of having hour long meetings with 16 people just to talk about having another meeting to talk about the color of a button to use?\r\n\r\nAre you stuck building a bunch of features \"just in case\" instead of getting something working in front of a user?\r\n\r\nDoes it take you more time to plan, document and release a simple change than it does to actually make the change?\r\n\r\nIf any of these resonate with you, then come learn about a simple question you, your team, and your company can ask yourselves that will help you cut through the bloat in your software process, and start delivering value like never before.",

This session is an introduction to amateur radio aimed toward IT professionals. Accordingly, the\r\nfocus will be on how to get licensed, and introducing the more technology focused aspects such as\r\ndigital communication modes, antenna design, and commonly used software.\r\nWhile amateur radio cannot be used for commerce, many lessons learned in the hobby are almost\r\ndirectly applicable to everyday work and you will walk away with a better understanding of wireless\r\ntechnology.",

This session also demonstrates when async/await is NOT needed, as well as when it is.\r\n\r\nAsync/await is wonderful, but it's not a cure-all.

      "description": "There's an old adage about fools and money being easily separated, but the same can be said for data. Every day, people are finding new and innovative ways to harvest information about you, whether it's for fame, fortune, or just for the lulz.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to be a victim, though. Applying some basic operational and information security (\"OpSec\" and \"InfoSec\", respectively) principles, we can better protect our personal information from those who might try to steal it.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll cover the fundamentals of what you should know to protect yourself both online and out in the real world. We'll cover topics including password security, phishing attacks, social engineering, and more. Attendees will leave with actionable steps they can use to reduce their own personal attack surfaces, along with a better understanding of the threats we face every day.",

      "description": "Finding new job opportunities can be stressful and intimidating. Talking about yourself might not be in your domain.  Questions of uncertainty may arise. How do I make myself more marketable?  How do I separate myself from the rest of the pack?  How do I keep myself fresh?\r\n\r\nThe goal of this talk is to help prepare you for what is next or what might be your future.  Let’s not just tell potential opportunities you have done something, you need to show them. Show them you know how to automate. Show them strategies you have used to train peers.  Show them your testing strategy. Show them you have used a test management system. Your resume might be able to say these things, but why not level up and show them your body of work?\r\n\r\nWhat you will gain from this presentation is tooling to increase knowledge, confidence, and a virtual portfolio that screams you should choose me!!!  It will also serve as a way for you to  reference your body of work form the past.  So when it is time to look for your next venture or freshen up on something you did in the past, your portfolio can speak for itself.\r\n",

      "description": "Product teams everywhere are embracing Agile. It’s no wonder why: Agile creates better transparency, alignment and speed to market. The problem is, Agile was originally created for software developers. Design teams which try to adopt Agile often find themselves falling into “Faux-gile” or “Wagile” (Waterfall in Agile clothing) practices as they balance strategic and tactical necessities, from wireframes to critical user discovery and validation. \r\n\r\nThis session will help design and UX teams:\r\n1. Balance UX strategy, research, tactics and validation activities in an Agile framework without sacrificing quality or budgets\r\n2. Avoid design debt that delays projects and risks expensive re-work by finding the happy medium between working too far ahead or behind development sprints\r\n3. Choose the right tools and metrics to create the transparency your clients, collaborators and leadership crave to ensure your product is on track \r\n4. Understand the importance of iteration and continued refinement",

The role for monitoring these applications on container or micro-services infrastructure both on-premises and in cloud is equally not clear and buzzword bloated. This discussion is for the SRE, SysOps, Developer, SysAdmins, DevOps, Ops…ENGINEER on how Elastic's Application Performance Monitoring can help.\r\n\r\nDevelopers: Listen to how APM can help with finding and fixing roadblocks in your code boils down to search and how monitoring supporting infrastructure. The APM UI lets you identify bottlenecks and zero in on problematic changes at the code level. As a result, you get better, more efficient code that leads to a speedier develop-test-deploy loop, faster applications, and better customer experiences.\r\n\r\nOps: Gain insight supporting application infrastructure and by monitoring flowing through your entire stack. String transactions together with a distributed trace and get a clear view of how your services are interacting. Find where latency issues are arising in the path and then pinpoint the components that need optimizing. With APM, your tracing data can coexist with your infrastructure logs, server metrics, security events, and more — making it easy to explore all of your data in one place, one UI.\r\n\r\nTogether, lets not just talk this mystical unicorn and Observability but demo Application Performance Monitoring.",

How do you understand and communicate what you’re great at and what you love to do (usually, but not always, the same things)?  Should you focus on excelling at your strengths or filling in your gaps?  How can you take a leadership role in charting your career path, and find the right environment to build it?\r\n\r\nAnd hiring managers can forget about the “War for Talent”: today there is a “Race for Talent.” That means organizations must as be nimble and agile in their people practices as they are in coding. It’s not enough to build great software: you must also build an environment where people can learn and grow. In other words, help your employees find a better job — with you!\r\n\r\nDan provides pragmatic strategies for great software professionals and the employers who love them.\r\n\r\nAbout Dan Broekhuizen\r\nNexient VP of People, guitarist, builder and family man Dan Broekhuizen has been crafting great organizational cultures for over 15 years.

These attacks can result in your intellectual property being stolen, or in compromised versions of your app being distributed, exposing user data and causing reputational damage. In this talk, I’ll discuss and, using an Android application, demonstrate some simple ways in which an attacker might approach your application as well as countermeasures that you can take to make their job much more difficult. I’ll cover renaming elements of your code, employing control flow obfuscation, and using string encryption in order to make your code much more difficult for an attacker to navigate. Additionally, I'll discuss using checks to verify the safety of the environment in which your app is running and react accordingly if it is running in an unsafe environment.",

      "title": "UX Journey from a Developer",
      "description": "(Presented by Sam Basu)\r\nMany of us have strived to bridge the designer-developer mindset gap – this is easier said than done. Turns out, shiny UI does not always mean good UX. We need to have user personas in mind, as well as a few core UX principles, throughout the software development lifecycle. In fact, designing good UX is a process – one that requires understanding behavioral patterns, iterating over user workflows and implementing core values.\r\n\r\nOne might say, designing for the right UX demands empathy. When we put love & care in the apps we build, we drive up user engagement. When we think about Accessibility, we broaden our user base. The right tools definitely help. And developers need to understand & be a part of UX journey all through. Come discover UX fundamentals from a developer’s perspective & some tools of the trade. We can all build better software together – just takes some humanity.",

This session will help you overcome those challenges by helping senior and junior team members communicate more effectively. You’ll discover ways to tailor your communication style to fit the introverts and extroverts on your team. This knowledge will help you run effective deployments with both onsite and distributed teams. Through a production manager’s case study and other real-life examples, you’ll leave with actionable steps for having a more successful, diverse, and creative development team. ",

In this session we’ll walk through a simple example application to show how simple it is to get a project up and running quickly.  We’ll also show how a developer might interact with running hardware and even push firmware updates directly to the system while it's running to see new changes reflected real time.",

If you answered yes to any of these or just find it difficult to manage and scale the styles for your project, chances are you are a victim of \"Accidental Architecture\".\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will discuss how to prevent \"Accidental Architecture\" from happening and instead discuss the benefits of Design Systems and how they can be leveraged to create meaningful architecture. We will also introduce some tools to assess your current applications as well as a framework and an architecture that is easy to adapt and implement from one project to another.",

Without the proper training, even well-meaning researchers can lead, bias, and manipulate users into getting the answers researchers want--instead of getting the real story needing to be told. In this talk, Ash will guide you through the basics of conducting user interviews:\r\n* Picking the right interview type\r\n* Asking the \"right\" questions\r\n* Do's/Don'ts of Interacting with Users\r\n* How to interpret your results\r\nUser research is difficult to do well and requires lots of practice. After this talk, you should have the resources you need to take the next steps to better user research.",

It automatically pits us against them, builders against breakers, developers against defenders.  A better approach is to view security like usability: they happen where man meets machine. At that moment of meeting, what factors in human psychology and industrial design are at play? And suppose we could pause time. Suppose we could tease out those factors. Could we design a better experience, design a better outcome, design a better path to the future? This session explores these questions and provides a case study in applied software design. The future is usability and security. Come learn how to design that future.",

In retros, you’re constantly coming up against inefficient, manual operations? Every step of building a software product eats away at your efficiency? Sounds like a job for DevOps. If you practice Agile for better organization and faster execution but don’t improve your infrastructure, you’ll only expedite your sprints to a point before you hit a wall: Agile’s terminal velocity. Applying DevOps to Agile increases your terminal velocity… forever. DevOps clears the field of bottlenecks so you’re able to work more and more effectively without falling into the landmines of productivity constraints. In this session, you’ll learn the art of making DevOps your ultimate Agile force multipler. \r\n\r\nAttendees will learn how to:\r\n\r\n1. Go fast forever by automating every instance and evolve a product over time with continuous testing.\r\n2. Kick legacy processes to the curb to ensure no one in your organization waits on the dev process ever again.\r\n3. Make decisions based on data, not on guesses, to achieve a feedback loop that powers killer products release after release. \r\n",

Solving problems is central to being a top-notch developer, it’s part of what separates the experts from the novices.\r\n\r\nOver the years I’ve come to realize that problem solving isn’t always easy, but it can be broken down into some basic steps.  These same steps were taught to me when I first learned physics, and have helped me solve numerous problems.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, you’ll have a mental framework for solving problems, and you’ll get to see that framework in practice as we solve problems that have happened on real-life software projects.",

      "description": "A very real problem is choosing what data to prioritize when storing it in a graph database. Most graph databases, including Neo4J, the number 1 graph database according to db-engines.com, do not scale horizontally. This leaves the size of the database constrained to how much disk space and ram is allocated on the single server that the graph database exists on. Due to these limitations and constraints, graph databases, in practice, only store a subset of the data - only the data which is the most valuable to be connected between nodes, edges, and properties, with the rest of the data being stored in another database solution, like MongoDB, Elasticsearch, or others. In a world of big data, cheap hard drives, and near-infinite self-provisioned cloud resources, having a single-server graph database solution is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore the current state of horizontally scaling graph databases. What are the limitations? What kind of performance can be expected? Do horizontally scaling graph databases sacrifice features such as consistent replication, high availability, and fault tolerance? \r\n\r\nThis talk will show Dgraph in use on economy-sized cloud infrastructure, horizontally scaling with big data, and acting as a primary database, mitigating the need to prioritize field storage and use two databases for full data storage.",

Come discover mutation testing and make sure your never forget another assert again.\r\n\r\nIn the realm of testing, the code coverage metrics is the most often talked about. However, it doesn’t mean that the test has been useful or even that an assert has been coded. Mutation testing is a strategy to make sure that the test code is relevant.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will explain how Code Coverage is computed and what its inherent flaw is. Afterwards, I will describe how Mutation Testing work and how it helps pointing out code that is tested but leave out corner cases. I will also demo PIT, a Java production-grade framework that enables Mutation Testing.",

      "description": "When our clients give us kudos for releasing high quality applications, it makes us happy. To achieve great levels of quality, we need to thoroughly test our applications. But we know that some forms of testing can be expensive and tedious at times. Unit and integration tests help overcome some of the testing challenges companies are facing today. We’ve all heard that these types of tests help reduce bugs in new features. While reduced bugs are a great benefit, the main goal of unit and integration testing is to drive better design. \r\n\r\nAs reusable units, React, Vue, or Angular components are perfect candidates for unit and integration testing. The \"Testing Library\" provides a great testing toolkit, which helps simulate how the user interacts with your application. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we will explore how you can leverage the Testing Library and Jest to test React, Vue, or Angular components. By the end of this session, you will be better equipped to test your UI components and improve the quality of your application.",

That’s like living in a world without usability testing. \r\n\r\nUsability testing is often confused with user acceptance testing (UAT) because they both involve getting feedback from users to create a better product. So what’s the difference, and do you really need both? \r\n\r\nDevelopers, quality engineers, product owners and other non-UX professionals will learn, once and for all, how user acceptance and usability testing differ in methodology, output and objective. Understand how implementing UAT ensures that the product works as designed, and how usability testing ensures you’re building a product that’s pleasing and intuitive for the user. Identify when to incorporate UAT and usability testing into the development cycle (hint: they happen at opposite stages!) — and which potential issues each process can uncover — from  bottlenecks that lead to user abandonment to tweaks needed to better integrate the software into business operations. Leave with a recipe for pairing user testing and usability testing to concoct an appetizing product for all.\r\n",

How will we deal with common business functionality, and where do concepts like CQRS and DDD fit in?\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll introduce the idea of vertical slice architectures, and dive into the patterns, tools, and techniques used with slices. We'll also cover how you can fit vertical slices into different kinds of systems, from desktop, SPA, and normal MVC applications. Finally, we'll look at some of the new challenges that come with slices and layers, and how a different approach provides a much more maintainable end result.",

What if I told you there was a way to capture all the events that led to that current state? Capturing all events would allow for deeper analytics/machine learning, debugging, auditing, and more all without affecting your production systems. In this talk we will explore the architecture, tools and patterns used to do just that. Before leaving this talk you will also learn about the stumbling blocks we ran into while implementing this against a temperamental legacy application.",

Job postings are incapable of giving the full picture of the job, but through networking with an existing team member it can provide great insights. Finding a new colleague that compliments other team members is nearly impossible by reading a resume.  Networking with others who have worked with your prospective colleague is invaluable. Asking coworkers for help, being considered for special assignment, or promotion are related to your networking skills. Having your thoughts and opinions carry more weight is correlated with your network of people. Finding and providing value to mentees can be positively impacted by your networking skills.

      "description": "Buildpacks are a pluggable, modular, language-agnostic tool that takes application source code and in turn give you an OCI (Open Container Initiative) image which you can run using Docker, Kubernetes or your OCI Runtime of choice.\r\n\r\nDevelopers: You no longer need to worry about tedious tasks like finding trusted images, installing/updating packages, adding agents and monitoring tools and writing Dockerfiles. You write code and buildpacks take care of the rest.\r\n\r\nThe higher-level abstraction of buildpacks allows you, as a developer, to focus less time on building containers and more time being productive, writing code and providing value for your employer.\r\n\r\nToo good to be true? Don't believe it? Come check out this session! It will explore how Cloud Native Buildpacks work, you'll see examples of how you can use them to create images from source code in your favorite languages, and you'll learn how to integrate buildpacks into common development workflows.",

For too long now, frameworks have gotten in the way of developers sharing code that they’ve written. With different APIs to work with, developers would have to rewrite a component multiple times to be able to work with React, Angular, Vue, or even Ember. Enter Web Components. Built on open web standards, Web Components provide a way for creating reusable components that can work within every framework, and even outside of them. Find out what Ionic’s been experimenting with and see why Web Components are the way of the future.",

A leader is just someone we follow. This talk will explore how we can lead those to our right and to our left.  How to lead from any level, not only as the “boss.” Many people in technical leadership roles were placed there because they were good at tech… not because they have any clue about what leadership is all about.  I was one of those and I had to learn to lead people. I’ll share my story of failed leadership and explain the biology behind leadership…that’s right biology, not psychology.  We as humans have biological elements that drive our leadership tendencies.  If you understand these, you can use them to become a better leader. Leadership is about training, there is no magic formula, but there are ways to train your leadership muscles, just like you would train your body.\r\n\r\nWhile you’re training to be a good leader, you need to understand that it’s a process, not a project. We are all creative in the strictest definition of the word. We create for a living. We create solutions to problems. Our projects have a start and an end. Leadership doesn’t work that way. There is no end; the end is a mirage. You’re only going to get better the further along you go in the journey. Don’t get frustrated; just understand that leadership is a process without an end.\r\n",

But that does not mean that technical skills alone are needed to code. When you sit down to actually write code, you engage in a fundamentally creative process.\r\n\r\nIn this session, you will learn about the parallels between making art and writing code. You will learn how creating software is like creating art, in terms of the people, processes, and products. You will learn about art techniques and their similarities to programming techniques.\r\n\r\nYou will leave this session a better programmer, having gained a better understanding of the deep, creative work that you do.",

Thinking about making data available through an API? There are innumerable ways to slice the problem. How do you implement pagination? What data model makes sense? What level of authentication is right to be secure, but usable?\r\n\r\nAt Stitch, we've built and reviewed almost 100 data integrations in Python for the Singer project, most of which interact with APIs, and have had good experiences ...and not-so-good experiences. This talk will explore these lessons through APIs in the wild, cover the challenges that we've faced when integrating with an API for ETL purposes, and highlight the qualities that make an API a joy to interact with.",

      "description": "If you're like the 2016 version of me, then you think you have a decent handle on web accessibility. You put alt attributes on all your images (though you don't give much thought to the actual text) and you make sure your sites can be used with a keyboard (except for overlays sometimes). Then the day comes when you're given a 100 page accessibility audit from a client and a deadline for all issues to be fixed. What is high contrast mode, you ask yourself, and why does it matter if these links are implemented in a list?\r\n\r\nThe fact is that we take for granted that people are able to use the sites we create. As governments pass legislation enforcing accessible standards, the web is playing catch up to the physical spaces we use every day. User interfaces are becoming more sophisticated, and it's easy for developers & designers without disabilities to overlook the simple things that many rely on to make sense of your site.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I'll share some of the hard lessons I've learned over the past few years, from both a development and a project management perspective. Topics discussed will include an overview of common accessibility problems, tools I use to validate accessibility issues, and best practices for training your team.",

And with all the focus on syntax changes, it’s easy to miss the subtle principles driving JavaScript. Modern JavaScript doesn’t just have new tools, it’s composed differently. Don’t use a feature without understanding why it matters. What problems does a new feature solve? How can new syntax make code easier to use and reuse? Modern JavaScript patterns follow three basic principles: predictability, readability, simple, and flexibility. In this session, attendees will learn how to think in modern JavaScript. Attendees will explore principles in modern JavaScript and learn how it applies to new syntax as well as upcoming language changes. Don’t just throw new syntax into old paradigms. Write intentional code.",

When defined correctly, the model feels natural and cohesive.  Defined wrong can make a system overly complex and end in disaster.\r\n\r\nJoin Derek as he explores the use of key terminology in real business systems. How dissecting simple words and asking the right questions led to insights that helped define the service boundaries in real business systems developed over the last decade.",

In practice, however, multiple perspectives often just lead to heated disagreements that leave technology teams feeling divided and defeated. Creating mechanisms to resolve disagreements in a healthy manner can both increase team chemistry and unlock the myriad of benefits of a diverse team.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll focus on a few of the most important tactics for dealing with disagreement. First, we'll take a look at the root causes of disagreement and examine how it's possible for disagreements to arise in the first place. We'll follow that up with two strategies attendees can apply immediately to disagreements: (1) disagree and commit, and (2) retrospective outlooks on disagreement. We'll look at concrete examples of how these strategies have solved disagreements and talk through not only how to apply them personally but also how to get a team on board. The result will be a robust perspective on dealing with disagreement - plus a genuinely enjoyable and productive work environment.",

But a front-end web app running in a framework like React or Vue can’t really use these same techniques since they typically run in the browser, not in the server environment. Yet they still need environment-specific configurations.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this problem can be breached at either build-time or run-time. This session demonstrates techniques for both, allowing you to manage your DevOps pipelines to create environment configurations appropriate to your situation. You’ll see WebPack for build-time configuration and run-time solutions hybridizing known server-side solutions, as well as using containers in Kubernetes. ",

But boxing it all away because you have \"work to do\" is like trying to run a marathon while carrying a Labrador Retriever.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't have to be that way. This talk will teach you how to frame your world using experiential language rather than clinical language, giving you a powerful tool to discuss your mental health in a way that can be easily felt and understood - and that won't get you in trouble with HR. That sharing becomes the key that unlocks the true power of your team... so come find out how to finally bring your whole self to work!",

      "title": "Serialization for the new micro service landscape",
      "description": "Serialization is often overlooked when developing backend systems, and this wasn’t (and still isn’t) a problem inside a monolith. But with the developing scene moving towards micro services, serialization becomes really important - how to serialize your data? What aspects do you need to consider? How to choose the best format and tools for your use case? Come learn about the aspects and tools to compare and select the right serialization option for your micro services!\r\n\r\nSerialization is used by any system that wants to talk another system, even itself. Different languages have different built-in options and tools. Java, for example, has the Serializable interface and ObjectOutputStream and many other libraries for serialization. Some play well with the native system, some are meant to be cross-platform compatible.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll present how to choose the right serialization option by exploring a new framework to help developers test their use cases and make the right choice for them. This covers five major areas: \r\n - size of the final byte array;\r\n - speed of serialization/deserialization;\r\n - native support by non-developer tools;\r\n - compatibility with other systems and languages; and\r\n - ease of development. \r\n\r\nWe need to use concrete examples so our serialization is complete, and for that we’ll compare major serialization options in the Java/JVM ecosystem like Java bult-in serialization, JSON, XML, Google Protobuf and Apache Avro, together with specific libraries for these formats, and apply them to a well known and simple use case. This comparison uses a framework to generate tests and numbers so that you’re able to make an informed decision.\r\n\r\nAfter this talk, we expect that the audience will be able to make their own comparisons to choose what’s best for their use cases, because there’s no one-size-fits-all solution when talking about serialization!\r\n",

What are qubits, superposition, and entanglement?  And how can you harness them to write programs?  In this session, you will learn the language and concepts of quantum, and understand what classes of problems are well-suited to quantum computing.  We will look at sample algorithms, debug a sample program with a simulator, and finish with a live demo running on an actual quantum computer in the cloud.",

Boasting 2.5 billion active devices, it can be found running on practically any hardware, from high-end flagship phones to smartwatches and IOT devices. Despite this massive popularity, the inner workings of Android are still a mystery to most. In this talk we'll jump on the command line and investigate a running Android system to gain a better understanding of all the things Android does for you. We'll look at what an app actually is and how it runs from the perspective of Android's Linux underpinnings, and we'll see what differentiates Android from a typical Linux distribution.",

      "description": "Have you ever wondered how many popular video games of the 70s, 80s, and 90s managed to look, sound, and play so well, despite running on very limited hardware? One reason is that many of these games were written in assembly languages. Unlike compiled or interpreted languages, in assembly the programmer manually decides the CPU instructions the program will execute. This “by hand” approach, while difficult, allowed game developers to maximize their use of the hardware and still keep a playable framerate. This session dives into the ancient art of assembly programming, with the Sega Genesis (a.k.a. Mega Drive) as an example. You will learn the basics of assembly languages and the unique quirks of video game hardware of the era, with examples from real assembly code for the Genesis’ Motorola 68000 processor. Attendees will even customize a simple homebrew game as part of the talk. You'll leave with a deeper understanding of computer architecture, the knowledge of what situations call for assembly programming, and the gratitude of being able to use higher-level languages in all other situations.",

      "description": "It's easy to get stuck in the, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” mindset with your software development process when real money is on the line, and deadlines loom. But taking the time to implement small changes to your pipeline, and foster a team attitude that's always looking for a “better way” can lead to a dramatic shift in productivity. You’ll learn how one group of developers, under serious working constraints, decided enough was enough, and started reshaping the way they thought about their decades-old development practices. Small changes lead to bigger changes, and faster adoption. The result is a dramatic out-performance of peer departments, and more importantly, their own past delivery. If you want to pull more time out of thin air, you can’t afford to stop examining your own process.",

      "description": "REST has been the de facto architecture for web APIs for 15 years, and its deficiencies are starting to become quite apparent. It is difficult to document, poor standardization, and lacks common tooling. For developers, this results in extra work when creating or consuming an API. The time has come for us to kill REST and start using RPC architecture. This talk will discuss why REST is deficient for modern applications and how adopting RPC can reduce development time, and reinforce more rigorous design standards. Using better standards leads to faster development, easier testing, and auto-generated clients. These points will be illustrated by comparing a simple API implemented in both REST and in gRPC, a standard created by Google. Other RPC standards will also be reviewed and compared to gRPC. ",

In this talk you'll learn all about Go by comparing it to programming languages you already know and love!\r\n\r\nGo is more than just learning new syntax. The language takes a fundamentally different approach to solve many problems that we as developers encounter everyday. Take package management for example, you may already be familiar with solutions like NuGet for .NET and npm for Node, but did you know Go just uses the source code repository? This approach not only simplifies how developers can share code with one another, but still facilitates immutability through Go modules. Some languages can go through a process called minification which replaces long variable and function names with shorter ones to reduce the overall footprint of the application, but Go simply ignores unused code right in its toolchain!\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, you'll walk away with knowing what makes Go special by leveraging knowledge you already know, and why Go might be your new favorite language.",

In the talk you will see examples of using Liquibase to manage database changes. You will learn how scripting and versioning your database structures will allow easy, scripted deployments that can be repeated by developers, in QA, and in prod. Once you see the ease at which you can deploy database changes, you will wonder how you ever got along without it.",

      "description": "Are you a programmer? Odds are you have a love of Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, and other devices of their ilk. These devices are easy to program, especially for a developer like you, but when it comes to building circuits for them to control, you're pretty much just following recipes online without a lot of understanding of what's going on. This talk will correct that.\r\n\r\nIn it, I'm going to explain the basics of electronics and the components that are commonly used to build circuits. I'll starts with Ohm's Law and will then cover basic components including resistors, diodes, capacitors, transforms, relays, and transistors. I'll use these components to build some basic circuits and explain them. And, I'll control these circuits from an Arduino and my laptop to show them in action!\r\n\r\nWhen we're done, you'll be able to build circuits that you can use for your own projects *and* have the knowledge on how they work. You won't know everything, but you'll have a wonderful start in learning to make and *understand* more complex circuits!",

      "description": "Diabetes is a disease that affects 400 million people worldwide. Managing the disease means eating a healthy diet, getting routine exercise, monitoring blood sugar levels and administering insulin to manage those levels. The good news is that technology exists to help people manage the disease. Continuous Glucose Monitors, Insulin pumps and even open source \"artificial pancreas\" solutions exist and help diabetics to manage their blood sugar levels with very little time and effort. All of these technologies make life easier, but they all still require the user to manually calculate and enter their carbohydrate consumption in order to calculate the necessary insulin dose. \r\n\r\nMy 13-year-old daughter was recently diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes and we have been slowly learning how to help her manage the disease. I was inspired to try to help solve the problem of carbohydrate counting so I came up with a Progressive Web Application that can be used to automate that process using things like image recognition, machine learning, web bluetooth, microservices and more. In this session we'll look at some of the technologies behind the application and how they all work together to try and solve the difficult problem of counting carbohydrates in order to calculate a necessary insulin dose.

Which makes sense -- connected systems introduce overhead and dependency, both of which reduce stability and decrease productivity during test-driven development (TDD). But if we wait for integration testing, critical functionality can get missed. In this session, we will discuss strategies for filling the data testing gap, directly within a Microsoft SQL Server environment. If you do a lot of work in T-SQL but aren't familiar with TDD, you'll learn the why and how of test-first development. If you're accomplished with unit tests, but never tried them in your database, you'll learn how to apply familiar concepts like setup, mocking, and assertion. We'll spend most of our time walking through a solution based on a real-world project, specifically using the open source tSQLt database unit testing framework.",

      "description": "AI is in the news seemingly every week. Whether it is people like Elon Musk or Steven Hawking warning the public about them or a new program that can beat humans at yet another task, it is definitely a hot topic. This talk will go through how an AI program that can play chess is actually made. Using fundamental data structures and algorithms (without machine learning), the AI will start from the ground up and use audience knowledge of the game to make it an exceptional chess player! Afterwards, attendees can attempt to beat the AI that was built.",

      "title": "5 Ideas For Writing Better Cloud Native Microservices",
      "description": "In theory, microservices are easy. The promise of loosely coupled, scalable services that can each be independently built, tested and deployed sounds amazing, doesn’t it? On top of that, each service can be written in whatever language the development deems appropriate – using their framework of choice – without any consequence to the rest of the architecture. Java services mixed with Node, Go, Ruby with each potentially persisting data to a different datastore. Maybe the Java service uses a key/value store?Perhaps the Go service persists to a traditional RDBMS? The future has truly arrived.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, microservices can present a new set of challenges for developers. Things that used to be easy like simple queries that join data from multiple sources are now handled differently. Tried and true concepts like transactions, referential integrity and DRY no longer mean as much when it comes to microservices. This new way of thinking can be difficult to grasp for some developers.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I'll show you some new ideas that you may not be familiar with that will help you develop performant microservices that are easy to maintain. Some of what we'll cover will look at new ways to solve some of challenges that microservice development brings and we'll discuss the benefits and downsides of each approach. I'll deploy a simple set of microservices using several languages and frameworks and we'll look at how to share data between the individual services and create a service that combines the data from multiple sources into a single feed of data. We'll also touch on other cloud native features that fit into your microservice application like serverless functions and cloud events.",

      "description": "Writing code that functions correctly is only part of the development process. The majority of our time is spent reading, maintaining and refactoring our code. In this talk we will discuss how when we see our work as code curation we actually enable our job to be much easier and productive. \r\n\r\nWe will start the talk with an introduction to the role of a curator and how it applies to software engineers.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will discuss some principals and techniques that enable us to produce better code but applying them with the curation mindset of maintaining code quality beyond producing the next bug free feature.\r\n\r\nSome of the topics we will cover:\r\n\r\n* Promote the use of conventions and style guides for your team\r\n\r\n* Promote refactoring in order to keep your code maintainable and readable\r\n\r\n* The first goal of writing tests should be to document the code functionality\r\n\r\n* Describe your code history via commits\r\n\r\n* Encourage discussion on feature implementation\r\n\r\n* Encourage discussion during code reviews\r\n\r\n* Boy Scout rule - leave the code in a better shape than which you found it\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the talk we will review the software curation mindset and how you can bring it to your organization.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this talk is to inspire attendees to take the curation mindset with them whenever they develop code.\r\nFocus not just on individual feature but on how to continuously create maintainable and stable code you can be proud of.",

      "description": "Have you ever thought about what open source software or hardware could achieve? What if it could help improve people's lives by solving some of their health problems?\r\n\r\nAfter the medical tech industry kept promising a system to help automatically manage insulin for type 1 diabetic people and never delivering, some people got together to find ways to do it with the tech they already had. Over the past few years, a \"closed-loop\" system has been developed to algorithmically regulate people's blood sugars. After reverse engineering bluetooth sensors and 915 MHz insulin pumps, the system became possible. As a diabetic, I also built this system and saw my sugar values stabilize much more than I could ever achieve doing it manually myself. Now I'm working on contributing back to the projects as well.\r\n\r\nI want to talk about this system, from a technical side as well as a personal side. I'll talk about OpenAPS (the open artificial pancreas system) and how it works, what problems it solves, and its safety and security concerns. I also want to show how it's helped me, and what this means for my health now and in the future. I ultimately want to show how we, as software developers, can change people's lives through the code we write.",

      "description": "The Story - Flutter is Google’s cross-platform development framework for quickly crafting high-quality native apps on Web, iOS, Android, and ChromeOS in record time. \r\n\r\nFlutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source. Notable apps written in Flutter include Abbey Road Studios first mobile app, Topline, the Hamilton Broadway Musical app, and Alibaba's Xianyu mobile app.\r\n\r\nFlutter breathes a breath of fresh air into the cross-platform development scene for many reasons which we will cover during the session.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the session will cover,\r\n\r\n1. What is Flutter?\r\n2. Why should you consider Flutter?\r\n3. What makes Flutter different?\r\n4. What you need to get quickly started creating great apps. \r\n\r\nAlong with the code snippets demonstrated during the talk, attendees can follow up afterwards at their own pace by using the code in a GitHub repo with all of the source code and the presentation (similar to this -> https://github.com/donwardpeng/Flutter-DetTechWatch)\r\n\r\nThe Call To Action -> Have an idea for a website or mobile app? You seriously need to consider creating it using Flutter. With the multitude of platforms it supports (from one codebase!) to the ease of getting started to create beautiful apps, Flutter is one of the first cross platform development frameworks to deliver.",

We can barely focus enough to get through the day and struggle with otherwise simple-for-us tasks. It starts there and gets much worse. So what are some of the things that cause us to burn out? We will draw from personal experiences and have a frank and productive discussions on some of the well-known, and not so well-known causes of burn out, how to recognize the symptoms, how to avoid getting burned out and some tricks on coping.",

      "title": "Walking A Mile In Your Users' Shoes",
      "description": "Developing apps for users in different demographics is inherently differently than developing apps just for ourselves and for other programmers. Understanding the needs of our users and learning to foster empathy for them is just as much of a skill as learning Rails or ActiveRecord — and it’s a skill that’s relevant to all developers, regardless of their ability level or rung of the career ladder.\r\n \r\nOne of the reasons that tech is a cool industry to work in is because “working in tech” doesn’t really confine you to working in the tech industry. Everyone needs applications! I consider it a perk that I can use my background in software engineering to work as a technologist in other industries because it gives me the opportunity to find a job I really care about, doing something I really find important.\r\n \r\nBut even if the code itself is more or less the same, different applications have different user bases. People who work at a company like Github, for example, can work under the assumption that most of their users are fairly similar in many ways to themselves. If their application is intuitive to them, it’s likely to also be intuitive to most of their users. Even within tech, that may not always be the case, particularly because different people have different accessibility needs. But when you’re working in other industries, it’s often much less true that what “works” for you as a programmer will also work for your users.\r\n \r\nThis talk, which will focus mainly on low-tech solutions, UX, and requirement gathering, is intended for developers at any skill level but will be of particular interest for people who do product work in non-tech industries. I’ll be using agriculture and healthcare as particular examples, but the advice is the same for anyone who works on any app that isn’t primarily targeted to other programmers and technologists.",

Every team should have a set of “ready” criteria that includes some kind of workshop between development team members to establish a shared understanding. In a time-boxed Example Mapping session, rules will summarize examples or constraints about a user story, and questions about outcomes or dependencies are documented for future refinement. The end result are requirements written as user behavior with a shared understanding among all roles on an Agile team. The audience will participate in a live Example Mapping session and learn how to implement the workshop within their own team.",

But developers and managers need a lot more to program data models.\r\n\r\nWith so many dataset tools for data science available, managers and developers can create statistical programming models, but are overwhelmed as to how to best explore the dataset. Most professionals conducting data science spend a majority of their time exploring and cleaning data. Databases are increasingly containing semi-structured data, thanks to varied sources such as social media, mobile devices, geolocation, and attributes describing real-world structures. Being able to blend data from a range sources and create useful correlation require some knowledge as to know when to apply exploratory steps effectively.\r\n\r\nThis brief talk will show how attendees can better plan for speedier analysis of datasets so that developer/manager teams can develop better regression and machine learning models. This session will cover the querying features in popular data repositories (Kaggle, data.world), data exploration techniques using libraries and functions in R Programming, and ideas to systematically communicate with team members on the data exploration process.\r\n\r\nThe end result is a faster means to establish a better quality dataset, leading to better analysis for regressions, machine learning models, and other data science projects.\r\n",

Swift has a diverse set of error-handling capabilities, from using throw to send errors up the stack to using a Result to handle errors in asynchronous methods. In this talk, we’ll look at the landscape of handling errors in Swift, create new ways of expressing and handling them, and show how even the most impossible code-level situations can have 100% test coverage. By the end, you’ll be taking control of the errors in your code, instead of letting them take control of you.",

      "description": "With the advances in multicore hardware and virtualization technologies, and the demand for highly responsive, resilient, and elastic systems and increasingly sophisticated applications, an array of reactive data stream processing libraries have been born to address the needs.  Reactive Streams is an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure. This encompasses efforts aimed at runtime environments that include JVM and Javascript, as well as network protocols.  So how do the various library implementations of Reactive Streams, such as Spring Reactor, Reactive Extension (Rx)'s Observables, and Akka Stream, stack up against each other?\r\n\r\nThis presentation will go into some details on how streams leverage on the underlying multicore processor to achieve parallelism.  It will then explain the push vs the pull streaming model.  It will then use a simple use case with code examples to illustrate the different API usages, as well as runtime processing analysis between a few popular Java implementations of Reactive Streams.\r\n",

You can't possibly live long enough to make them all yourself.\" -Samuel Levenson \r\n\r\nThis talk is a fun, fast-moving survey of some of the best recent bug bounty finds against some of the largest and best-known applications in the world. Some of the bugs are really simple, some are super complex, but all are entertaining. As we go through these, we'll take a look at what caused the issue, and how to fix it. \r\n\r\nFrom this talk, you'll walk away with: \r\n* a few minutes of entertainment \r\n* a view of the wide breadth of security issues \r\n* practical ideas on testing and shoring up security in your own applications \r\n* (maybe) a new side gig as a bug bounty hunter!",
